### Utility Tree
| Q-Attribute |	Refinement |	Quality attribute scenarios |	Business Value |	Technical Risk |
|-------------|------------|------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Interoperability |	API-Specification |	on localhost:8080/api you are able to view endpoint specifications |	M |	L |
| Modifiable |	granular-structured backend |	Through the standardized use of spring boot and a relational database schema is the backend easily expandable | H |	H |			
|Useability	| User-Feedback	| The user can tell us how can improve even further	| M	| M |
|Intuitive Design |	The website guides the user through its intuitive and simple design	| H |	M |
|Testability	| Testing frameworks	| During the development phase we use automated tests to help fulfill our quality requirements	| H	| M |

### Architectural decisions:
- Test-driven development: We want to write tests in the future for our code. We started to write a few tests but we try to increase code coverage
- We implemented an automated API-Specification
- We will implement a feedback page as soon as the main features are working. This feature will be easily implemented due to our granular structured program
- We use the principles of clean-code-developement (KISS, DRY)
- We will implement a feedback page as soon as the main features are working. This feature will be easily implemented due to our granular structured program
- We use widespread design principles for our frontend



### Other
- update class diagramm - [backend](https://github.com/dhbw-ka-tinf22b5-dinder/Dinder-SRS/blob/main/Diagramme/Klassendiagramme/Backend.png) (delete chat-class, divide service-class, optimize visualisation)
