### Frontend:
We built a simple login and registration form and a front page.
We also created a navigation bar with a logo and implemented routing.
When you click on the logo, you come back to the front page.

There is no logic behind it at the moment because React is relatively new to us
and we had to spend a lot of time learning it.

### Backend:
We have implemented simple cookie authentication for API calls, 
as well as a simple login interface and integrated the database. 

The database was changed from MariaDB to PostgreSQL due to available free hosts, 
and the database host is Supabase. The first draft for the individual tables 
was also created for the database.
