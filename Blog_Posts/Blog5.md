### Frontend (Demo):


### Backend:
We have implemented simple cookie authentication for API calls, 
as well as a simple login interface and integrated the database. 

The database was changed from MariaDB to PostgreSQL due to available free hosts, 
and the database host is Supabase. The first draft for the individual tables 
was also created for the database.
