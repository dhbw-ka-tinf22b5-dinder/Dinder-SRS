## Biggest technological risk
Our biggest risk is poor code quality (ID2, RMMM). Thats why peer review and discuss our changes and use test pipelines.
The aim is to achieve the highest possible test coverage in order to eliminate bugs as far as possible.
For the test execution, pipelines are to be written in github actions, which are triggered by pull requests.
