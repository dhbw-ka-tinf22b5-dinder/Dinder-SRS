## Biggest technological risk
Our biggest risk is poor code quality (ID 2, RMMM). Thats why we use peer reviews and discuss our changes. In addition we will use test pipelines.
The aim is to achieve the highest possible test coverage in order to eliminate bugs as far as possible.
For the test execution, pipelines are to be written in github actions, which are triggered by pull requests.

## Last changes
Since Lukas Schulz is no longer part of the group, we had to redistribute his tasks. This means that we had to learn the front-end technologies that Lukas had been working on. As a result, we have not yet been able to implement any major changes to the actual program.
