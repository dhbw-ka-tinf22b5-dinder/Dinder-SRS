### Architectural Goals

## We want modularity so we can easily implement new features. We ensure this by using Springboot. With this framework we are able to easily create new api endpoints. OpenAPI and redoc then create an api-specification for the new endpoint automatically.

## The backend does all the logic while our frontend acts only as an interface to the api. Thus we would also be able to create an Android or IOS-App very easily in the future.
## We currently don't use test driven development but we will write tests in the future


### Constraints:

We develop this as pure webapp
timeframe till end of 4th semester
We use React because we have the most experience in this framework
It is mandatory to use free tools and hosting providers.
Our experience with building webprojects is limited
